      - Never introduce a permanent ban on a domain that was previously allowed.
      - Only re-shape timing, micro-step size, and scheduling within fixed envelopes.

# 1. Neuromorph and BCI research
research_goal:
  id: "goal.neuromorph.bci.decoding"
  proof_status: "pending"
  domain: "neuromorph.decoder"
  description: |
    Improve neuromorph/BCI event encoders and decoders (EEG/EMG/motion,
    hybrids like EEG+fNIRS, transformer-style models) to reduce false
    positives and latency, while keeping EVOLVE read-only and tokens
    strictly non-financial.
  benefit_to_capability:
    - "Higher decoding accuracy and lower latency for neuromorph commands."
    - "More responsive reflex and attention control within existing envelopes."
    - "Better utilization of already-approved evolution capacity."
  benefit_to_karma:
    - "Supports safer interaction and reduced frustration for self and others."
    - "Enables more precise defensive and prosocial actions via neuromorph loops."
  no_new_ceiling_proof: |
    Formalization:
      - All changes are confined to decoder internals (classification and encoding),
        with no changes to EVOLVE formula, token ceilings, or allowed domains.
      - The function space of allowed policies is unchanged; only mapping from
        signals to proposals is improved.
      - Proof obligation: show that for any previous admissible evolution path,
        an equivalent or better path remains admissible under updated decoders.

research_goal:
  id: "goal.neuromorph.shadow_reflex"
  proof_status: "pending"
  domain: "neuromorph.reflex"
  description: |
    Run daily shadow-reflex experiments where neuromorph policies compute
    hypothetical actions, compare against actual outcomes, and update
    policies, all inside verified envelopes and without direct actuation.
  benefit_to_capability:
    - "Improved predictive power and reflex stability over time."
    - "Higher-quality policy priors before enabling live reflex mode."
  benefit_to_karma:
    - "Demonstrates caution and responsibility: learning before acting."
    - "Generates audit trails for proving non-harmful reflex design."
  no_new_ceiling_proof: |
    Formalization:
      - Shadow mode never triggers ledger state changes; it only updates
        policy parameters within a fixed hypothesis class.
      - No domains are reclassified as disallowed; only policy quality changes.
      - Proof obligation: show that the set of allowed SystemAdjustment types
        is identical before and after policy learning.

# 2. DECAY and invited-pain modeling
research_goal:
  id: "goal.decay.invited_pain_modeling"
  proof_status: "pending"
  domain: "evolution.decay"
  description: |
    Refine DECAY schedules to incorporate invited-pain corridors and
    longitudinal history, allowing larger steps when strain is consciously
    invited and lifeforce/eco are healthy, without external preferences
    ever forcing downscaling.
  benefit_to_capability:
    - "Faster evolution along paths the host explicitly chooses as growth."
    - "Better matching between subjective 'good pain' and step size."
  benefit_to_karma:
    - "Rewards responsible self-chosen challenge with more efficient progress."
    - "Maintains clear distinction between productive strain and harmful stress."
  no_new_ceiling_proof: |
    Formalization:
      - DECAY is constrained to [d_min, 1.0] with d_min > 0 whenever:
          invited_pain=true AND core lifeforce/eco invariants hold.
      - DECAY may never be used to delete an evolution domain; only to
        scale per-step deltas.
      - Proof obligation: for any domain D allowed by doctrine, there exists
        a sequence of steps with non-zero DECAY leading to any previously
        reachable state, preserving evolution reachability.

research_goal:
  id: "goal.decay.longitudinal_history"
  proof_status: "pending"
  domain: "evolution.decay"
  description: |
    Incorporate longitudinal history of which mutation paths feel
    productive versus draining into DECAY tuning, so the runtime can
    recognize and support 'good pain' corridors.
  benefit_to_capability:
    - "More personalized evolution dynamics aligned with actual experience."
    - "Reduced wasted effort on draining, low-yield paths."
  benefit_to_karma:
    - "Encourages sustainable, self-aware interaction with evolution tools."
    - "Aligns DECAY with patterns that minimize unnecessary distress."
  no_new_ceiling_proof: |
    Formalization:
      - Historical penalties can increase DECAY damping but cannot mark a
        doctrinally-allowed path as permanently forbidden.
      - Host consent may reset or re-weight history under explicit shards.
      - Proof obligation: show that DECAY history only changes convergence
        speed along a path, not its theoretical availability.

# 3. Autonomy and assistant-governor research
research_goal:
  id: "goal.autonomy.assistant_profile"
  proof_status: "pending"
  domain: "assistant.autonomy"
  description: |
    Train and tune AssistantAutonomyProfile and governor ramps so that
    assistants can take more actions when lifeforce/eco and risk metrics
    are good, while remaining propose-only and neurorights-compliant.
  benefit_to_capability:
    - "Higher effective throughput on repetitive tasks."
    - "Reduced cognitive load while preserving oversight."
  benefit_to_karma:
    - "Rewards consistent safe use with smoother assist ramps."
    - "Provides traceable accountability for autonomy decisions."
  no_new_ceiling_proof: |
    Formalization:
      - Autonomy ramps may change frequency and detail of proposals, but
        cannot directly modify EVOLVE, SCALE, or allowed domains.
      - Final execution always requires host-side acceptance or pre-granted,
        revocable consent shards.
      - Proof obligation: prove non-interference: autonomy level L1 vs L2
        does not change the set of actions that *could* be taken, only how
        many are proposed and how quickly.

research_goal:
  id: "goal.autonomy.assist_ramp_validation"
  proof_status: "pending"
  domain: "assistant.autonomy"
  description: |
    Validate assist ramps via simulation and trace mining for smoothness,
    neurorights budgets, and budget adherence, using negative exemplars
    to iteratively refine ramps.
  benefit_to_capability:
    - "More intelligent, context-aware assist that stays within your comfort."
  benefit_to_karma:
    - "Supports ethical assist behavior by avoiding overreach and coercion."
  no_new_ceiling_proof: |
    Formalization:
      - Ramps are validated only inside the already-proved safe region;
        they cannot introduce new hard thresholds.
      - Negative exemplars may tighten risk thresholds but cannot alter
        core doctrinal invariants.
      - Proof obligation: show that ramp changes preserve the doctrinal
        invariants schema and do not modify the evolution domain lattice.

# 4. Eco-budget and microspace sovereignty
research_goal:
  id: "goal.eco.improved_band_models"
  proof_status: "pending"
  domain: "eco.budget"
  description: |
    Improve EcoBandProfile and neuromorph-eco-profile.aln so that heavy
    neuromorph work is scheduled into eco-favorable windows, increasing
    safe usable compute without changing token ceilings.
  benefit_to_capability:
    - "More total neuromorph compute over time for the same eco limits."
    - "Higher-quality experiments and training runs."
  benefit_to_karma:
    - "Encourages eco-conscious scheduling and reduced waste."
  no_new_ceiling_proof: |
    Formalization:
      - Eco bands may shift WHEN workloads run, not WHETHER a domain is
        allowed in principle.
      - Eco denials are temporary, bounded by eco recovery; they cannot
        mark domains as permanently disallowed.
      - Proof obligation: show that for any allowed workload, there exists
        some schedule that satisfies eco constraints in finite time.

research_goal:
  id: "goal.microspace.firewall_hardening"
  proof_status: "pending"
  domain: "security.microspace"
  description: |
    Strengthen microspace firewall rules so no research run can leak
    balances, raw EEG, or inner-ledger data outward, enabling more
    aggressive internal exploration with guaranteed sovereignty.
  benefit_to_capability:
    - "Allows higher-risk internal experiments with reduced external risk."
  benefit_to_karma:
    - "Protects others by preventing leakage or unintended influence."
  no_new_ceiling_proof: |
    Formalization:
      - Firewalls constrain data egress channels, not internal evolution.
      - No firewall rule may modify EVOLVE, SCALE, or per-domain legality;
        they only restrict what leaves microspace.
      - Proof obligation: prove that the internal state transition graph
        under research actions is unchanged; only observability is reduced.

# 5. Karma/aura and defensive domains
research_goal:
  id: "goal.aura.defensive_decay_shaping"
  proof_status: "pending"
  domain: "governance.aura"
  description: |
    Calibrate BiophysicalAura so it only nudges DECAY for clearly defensive
    and biosafe domains (reflex stability, defensive morphology) and never
    gates fundamental rights or introduces comparative rankings.
  benefit_to_capability:
    - "More efficient growth in defensive and stabilizing traits."
  benefit_to_karma:
    - "Rewards prosocial, protective behavior without creating hierarchies."
  no_new_ceiling_proof: |
    Formalization:
      - Aura multipliers only adjust DECAY in a small bounded range and
        never flip an allowed domain to forbidden.
      - Aura is per-host and non-comparative; no cross-host rankings.
      - Proof obligation: show that removing aura (setting multipliers to 1)
        returns to the same domain lattice, proving aura cannot encode bans.

research_goal:
  id: "goal.defense.teeth_claws_civic_tags"
  proof_status: "pending"
  domain: "evolution.defense"
  description: |
    Refine civic tags and NeuralRope annotations for defensive domains
    (e.g., teeth/claws-as-defense) so the system can distinguish legitimate
    protection from offensive misuse while preserving maximum freedom for
    self-defense.
  benefit_to_capability:
    - "Enables robust defensive traits under clear, fair conditions."
  benefit_to_karma:
    - "Aligns defensive evolution with non-aggression and protection of others."
  no_new_ceiling_proof: |
    Formalization:
      - Domain 'TeethClawsDefense' remains allowed but is capped by SCALE
        and per-day micro-step limits, already defined in doctrine.
      - Offensive misuse is detected via civic tags but handled by
        reduced DECAY or domain-specific caps, not by permanent removal
        of the defensive domain.
      - Proof obligation: show that self-defense scenarios remain reachable
        under doctrine, while offensive-only scenarios are denied by
        existing invariants, not by new ceilings introduced here.
